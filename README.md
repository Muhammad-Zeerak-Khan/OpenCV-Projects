# SOME APPLICATIONS OF OPENCV-PYTHON

This repo discusses some basic applications of OpenCV-Python which could help in the image preprocessing for Neural Networks.
* Face Detection
* Eyes Detection
* Feature Extraction
  
All the above could be performed on images(jpg, jpeg, png) or videos from the memory or on the LiveFeed from the webcam  as well.
